# KeyCum-1.0
KeyCum is a simple yet opensource project which uses math to generate combinations for vivid requests.

KeyCum-1.0 is just the start of the project which only include a 4 digit combination generator.
As time goes on this project will be updated.

KeyCum-2.0 is hoped to come with all numerical digit calculator from 1 digits to 10 digits.
KeyCum-2.0 will also have a better Command Line Interface.

Thanks
